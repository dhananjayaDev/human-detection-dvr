Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Human Detection DVR (Digital Video Recorder) system. The project aims to implement real-time human detection using computer vision techniques, integrated with a DVR system for surveillance and monitoring purposes.
Features

Real-Time Human Detection: Utilizes advanced computer vision algorithms to detect humans in video feeds.
DVR Integration: Seamlessly records and stores video footage with human detection events.
Customizable Alerts: Configurable notifications for detected human activities.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for managing recordings and settings.

Requirements

Python 3.8+
OpenCV
TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the model used)
FFmpeg for video processing
A compatible DVR hardware or software setup

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/dhananjayaDev/human-detection-dvr.git
cd human-detection-dvr


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Configure the DVR settings in config.yaml (create this file based on config.example.yaml).
Run the application:python main.py



Usage

Launch the application using the command above.
Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000 (or the configured port).
Configure detection parameters and DVR settings through the interface.
Monitor real-time detection and review recorded footage.
